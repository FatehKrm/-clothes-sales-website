This is the largest project I’ve worked on, and I’ve been developing it for about 3 months using ASP.NET Core with C#. It follows a 4-layer architecture (Entity, Data Access, Business, UI) with Entity Framework and the Generic Repository pattern. The project includes an admin panel and main website for managing products and tracking revenue.
